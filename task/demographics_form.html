<!--

    This is the HTML page for your Demographics Form.
    This loads the JavaScript for that, 'demographics_form.js'.

    A Demographics Form should be filled out before the start of the experiment by every participant.
    'Parse_Raw_Data.py' for parsing your data creates a Participant Demographics file separate from your data. 
    Pleases store this Participant Demographics file in your Synology project folder and Synology IRB project subfolder.

    This corresponds to a single Component in JATOS, with 'demographics_form.html' being the 'HTML file path'. 
    See 'Instructions for Running an Online Experiment: Creating a new study in JATOS' for more info.
    Usually, this Component should sequentially come immediately after your Consent Form.

    INSTRUCTIONS FOR MODIFICATION:

    This file likely needs no modification.
