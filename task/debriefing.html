<!--

	This is the HTML page for your Debriefing.
    This loads the JavaScript for that, 'debriefing.js'.

    A Debriefing should be seen at the end of the experiment by every participant. 
    This should be a one or two paragraph description of the purpose of the experiment. It should be in language that is understandable by non-scientists.

    This corresponds to a single Component in JATOS, with 'debriefing.html' being the 'HTML file path'. 
	See 'Instructions for Running an Online Experiment: Creating a new study in JATOS' for more info.
    Usually, this Component should sequentially come after your experiment Component(s), at the end of the experiment.

    INSTRUCTIONS FOR MODIFICATION:

    This file likely needs no modification.
