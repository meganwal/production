				<h2>Online Consent Form</h2>

				<div class="legal well">
					<p>This experiment is part of a research study conducted by Dr. Daniel Yurvosky and Dr. Bonnie Nozari at Carnegie Mellon University.</p>

					<p><b>Source of Funding:</b> National Science Foundation, internal CMU funds</p>

					<p><b> <h5>Summary</h5> </b> This consent form contains information about the study that you are about to participate in. Your participation allows us to learn about language processing in the human brain. The data from this study might help us design better methods for language learning in children, second-language learning in adults, and re-learning of language in individuals with brain damage. </p>

					<p><b><h5>Purpose </h5></b> The purpose of the research is to investigate how people express their thoughts using words and sentences, how they detect and correct their errors, and how they learn new words.
					</p>

					<p><b><h5>Procedures </h5></b>  In this experiment, you will see pictures, words, or video clips, and will respond to them verbally or by pointing or pressing buttons. You may be asked to respond as quickly and as accurately as you can. The procedures will be explained in detail in the instructions for each task. Your participation is voluntary, and you can terminate your participation at any point.
					</p>

					<p>During this activity, we may ask you to:<li>Make decisions about words, sentences or pictures</li> <li>Name pictures or describe visual events</li><li>Read, write, or type words or sentences</li> <li>Click on objects on the screen or respond by pressing buttons</li> <li>Memorize and recall words, phrases, or pictures you may have seen or heard during the experiment</li>
					</p>

					<p><b><h5> Audio/Video Recording </h5></b>
					<p>Your responses are registered and your voice will be audio recorded.</li> <li>_____ Your participation in this study will also include video-recording for research purposes.</li> <li>__*__ Your participation in this study will not include video-recording for research purposes.</li>
					</p>



					<p><b><h5>Duration of the Study </h5></b> The number of sessions can vary between 1 and 6. Your participation is expected to be __1__ session(s). Each session can take between 30-120 minutes depending on the specific experiment. Your sessions are expected to take __40__ minutes.  If your participation involves multiple sessions, there should be a minimum of __N/A__ day(s) and a maximum of __N/A__ day(s) between subsequent sessions.</p>



					<p><b><h5>Participant Requirements</h5></b> You are eligible if: <li>You are 18 years of age or older.</li><li>You have not been diagnosed with any psychiatric or neurological impairments (such as ADD, anxiety disorders, etc.), and you are not actively using psychotropic medication (with the exception of anti-depressants).</li><li> __*__ This study requires being a native speaker of English.</li></p>

					<p><b> <h5>Risks</h5> </b> The risks and discomfort associated with participation in this study are no greater than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during other online activities. You may experience fatigue and frustration in some tasks, but you will be given breaks to alleviate any potential for stress or boredom, and you are free to withdraw your participation at any time.
					</p>

					<p><b><h5>Benefits</h5> </b> There may be no personal benefit from your participation in the study but the knowledge received may be of value to humanity.</p>

					<p> <b> <h5>Compensation & Costs</h5> </b> If you are participating through CMU’s Department of Psychology participant pool, you are eligible to receive research credit. If you are not participating for research credit, you are eligible for monetary compensation. The exact amount varies based on length and difficulty of the task, but compensation will not be less than $5 per hour.</p>

					<p>There will be no cost to you if you participate in this study.</p>


					<p> <b> <h5>Future Use of Information</h5> </b> In the future, once we have removed all identifiable information from your data, we may use the data for our future research studies, or we may distribute the data to other researchers for their research studies. We would do this without getting additional informed consent from you (or your legally authorized representative). Sharing of data with other researchers will only be done in such a manner that you will not be identified.</p>


					<p><b><h5>Confidentiality</h5> </b>The data captured for the research does not include any personally identifiable information about you. Your IP address will not be captured. For studies funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), the NSF may have access to the data. </p>

					<p><b><h5>Payment Confidentiality</h5> </b>Payment methods, especially those facilitated by third-party vendors (such as Venmo, Amazon, PayPal), may require that the researchers and/or the vendor may collect and use personal information (first and last name, email addresses, phone numbers, banking information) provided by you in order for your payment to be processed. As with any payment transaction there is the risk of a breach of confidentiality from the third-party vendor. All personal information collected by the researcher will be held as strictly confidential and stored in a password-protected digital file, or in a locked file cabinet, until payments are processed and reconciled. This information will be destroyed at the earliest acceptable time.</p>

					<p>Please be aware that any work performed on Amazon MTurk can potentially be linked to information about you on your Amazon public profile page, depending on the settings you have for your Amazon profile. We will not be accessing any personally identifying information about you that you may have put on your Amazon public profile page. We will store your MTurk worker ID separately from the other information you provide to us.</p>

					<p>If you are performing this study on Prolific, we will be using Prolific’s built-in demographic screening to ensure that your participation meets our demographic requirements (such as age and native-speaker status). However, we will not be able to access any other personally identifying information from your Prolific account. We will store your Prolific ID separately from the other information you provide to us.</p>


					<p> <b> <h5>Rights</h5> </b> Your participation is voluntary. You are free to stop your participation at any point. Refusal to participate or withdrawal of your consent or discontinued participation in the study will not result in any penalty or loss of benefits or rights to which you might otherwise be entitled. The Principal Investigator may at his/her discretion remove you from the study for any of a number of reasons. In such an event, you will not suffer any penalty or loss of benefits or rights which you might otherwise be entitled.
					<p>
